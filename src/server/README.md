## Starting the server

`npm run dev` will use the files in the `src` folder to run the server. This option is best during development.

`npm run start` will use the dist folder to run the server. In order to use this, you must first run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript files into a dist folder.

`npm run simulate` will run a simulation of an example game. Should be used for testing the game logic.
